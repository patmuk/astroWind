<p>... it has been a while since I posted last time ... and now basically just a post about some links
  is following ;)</p>
<p>When I am asked why I prefer Mercurial over git I did not have a real strong argument.<br />
  All-in-all they are conceptually very similar, and one can do everything with Mercurial what one can do with
  git.<br />
  But Mercurial is easier to use!<br />
  And that really is the bottom line!
</p>
<p>Every time I use git I am surprised how unnecessary complicated it is to be used. The<br />
  'principle of least surprise' is not followed, etc ... in the end it is merely a tool for repository maintainers then
  developers.<br />
  <a href="http://stevebennett.me/2012/02/24/10-things-i-hate-about-git/">Steve Bennett's "things I hate about git"</a>
  makes valid points with good examples. Unlike the title suggests it is not a rant, but a list of what is not that well
  designed in git.
</p>
<p>Similar to the excellent introduction to Mercurial <a href="http://hginit.com">HGinit</a> there are helpful webpages
  about git:<br />
  <a href="https://people.gnome.org/~newren/eg/">EasyGit</a> enables to use git commands in a more intuitive way.
</p>
<p><a href="http://think-like-a-git.net">Think like git</a> is an excellent source for understanding git.<br />
  If you are a visual learner <a href="https://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html">visual git guide</a>
  is really helpful.<br />
